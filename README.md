## Moonfall 
**Directed By: Roland Emmerich**

*Starring Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, John Bradley, Michael PeÃ±a, Charlie Plummer, Kelly Yu, and Donald Sutherland*
> In the movie Moonfall, an unknown force dislodges the Moon from its trajectory around Earth and sends it hurtling toward the Earth and life as we know it. Jo Fowler, a NASA executive and former astronaut, is confident she has the secret to rescuing us all with just weeks to go before impact and the planet on the verge of catastrophe, but only one astronaut from her past, Brian Harper, and a conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman has faith in her. Leaving behind everyone they love, these unlikely heroes will attempt an impossible last-ditch trip into space, only to discover that they may have been prepared for the wrong mission.
